## 1\. Introduction

_This section is non-normative._

WebDriver defines a protocol for introspection and remote control of user agents. This specification extends WebDriver by introducing bidirectional communication. In place of the strict command/response format of WebDriver, this permits events to stream from the user agent to the controlling software, better matching the evented nature of the browser DOM.

## 2\. Infrastructure

This specification depends on the Infra Standard. \[INFRA\]

Network protocol messages are defined using CDDL. \[RFC8610\]

This specification defines a wait queue which is a map.

Surely there’s a better mechanism for doing this "wait for an event" thing.

When an algorithm algorithm running in parallel awaits a set of events events, and resume id:

1.  Pause the execution of algorithm.
    
2.  Assert: wait queue does not contain resume id.
    
3.  Set wait queue\[resume id\] to (events, algorithm).
    

To resume given name, id and parameters:

1.  If wait queue does not contain id, return.
    
2.  Let (events, algorithm) be wait queue\[id\]
    
3.  For each event in events:
    
    1.  If event equals name:
        
        1.  Remove id from wait queue.
            
        2.  Resume running the steps in algorithm from the point at which they were paused, passing name and parameters as the result of the await.
            
            Should we have something like microtasks to ensure this runs before any other tasks on the event loop?
            

A WebDriver configuration is a struct with:

-   item global which is a value, initially unset;
    
-   item user contexts which is a weak map between user contexts and value, initially empty;
    
-   item navigables which is a weak map between navigables and value, initially empty.
    

A WebDriver configuration has an associated type which is a type.

The value for a WebDriver configuration is either a value whose type is the associated type for that configuration or unset.

Unset is a value indicating that a specific configuration value has not been set.

Note: this algorithm allows accessing the WebDriver configuration for a given navigable by checking values in navigables, then in user contexts and finally in global. Returns unset if configuration is not set.

To get WebDriver configuration value of WebDriver configuration configuration for navigable navigable:

1.  Let top-level traversable be navigable’s top-level traversable.
    
2.  If configuration’s navigables contains top-level traversable:
    
    1.  Let navigable configuration value be configuration’s navigables\[top-level traversable\].
        
    2.  If navigable configuration value is not unset, return navigable configuration value.
        
3.  Let user context be navigable’s associated user context.
    
4.  If configuration’s user contexts contains user context:
    
    1.  Let user context configuration value be configuration’s user contexts\[user context\].
        
    2.  If user context configuration value is not unset, return user context configuration value.
        
5.  Return configuration’s global.
    

Note: this is a generic algorithm for storing WebDriver configuration per target, which can be either navigable, user context, or store it globally if the target is null or omitted.

To store WebDriver configuration configuration’s value value in optional target which is a navigable, a user context or null if not provided:

1.  If target is null, set configuration’s global to value.
    
2.  If target is a user context, set configuration’s user contexts\[target\] to value.
    
3.  If target is a navigable, set configuration’s navigables\[target\] to value.
    

Note: This generic algorithm stores WebDriver configuration’s value in global, user contexts, or navigables, depending on the presence of "`userContexts`" and "`contexts`" in command parameters. These parameters are mutually exclusive. If neither is provided, the configuration is stored globally.

To store WebDriver configuration WebDriver configuration configuration’s value value for given command parameters:

1.  If command parameters contains "`userContexts`" and command parameters contains "`contexts`", return error with error code invalid argument.
    
2.  Let affected navigables be an empty set.
    
3.  If command parameters contains "`contexts`":
    
    1.  Let navigables be the result of trying to get valid top-level traversables by ids with command parameters\["`contexts`"\].
        
    2.  For each navigable of navigables:
        
        1.  Append navigable to affected navigables.
            
        2.  Store configuration’s value in navigable.
            
4.  Otherwise, if command parameters contains "`userContexts`":
    
    1.  Let user contexts be the result of trying to get valid user contexts with command parameters\["`userContexts`"\].
        
    2.  For each user context of user contexts:
        
        1.  For each top-level traversable in the list of all top-level traversables whose associated user context is user context:
            
            1.  Append top-level traversable to affected navigables.
                
        2.  Store configuration’s value in user context.
            
5.  Otherwise:
    
    1.  For each top-level traversable of all top-level traversables, append top-level traversable to affected navigables.
        
    2.  Store configuration’s value.
        
6.  Return affected navigables.
    

## 3\. Protocol

This section defines the basic concepts of the WebDriver BiDi protocol. These terms are distinct from their representation at the transport layer.

The protocol is defined using a CDDL definition. For the convenience of implementers two separate CDDL definitions are defined; the remote end definition which defines the format of messages produced on the local end and consumed on the remote end, and the local end definition which defines the format of messages produced on the remote end and consumed on the local end

### 3.1. Definition

Should this be an appendix?

This section gives the initial contents of the `remote end definition` and `local end definition`. These are augmented by the definition fragments defined in the remainder of the specification.

`Remote end definition`

```
Command
```

`Local end definition`

```
Message
```

`Remote end definition` and `Local end definition`

```
Extensible
```

### 3.2. Session

WebDriver BiDi extends the session concept from WebDriver.

A session has a BiDi flag, which is false unless otherwise stated.

A BiDi session is a session which has the BiDi flag set to true.

The list of active BiDi sessions is given by:

1.  Let BiDi sessions be a new list.
    
2.  For each session in active sessions:
    
    1.  If session is a BiDi session append session to BiDi sessions.
        
3.  Return BiDi sessions.
    

### 3.3. Modules

The WebDriver BiDi protocol is organized into modules.

Each module represents a collection of related commands and events pertaining to a certain aspect of the user agent. For example, a module might contain functionality for inspecting and manipulating the DOM, or for script execution.

Each module has a module name which is a string. The command name and event name for commands and events defined in the module start with the module name followed by a period "`.`".

Modules which contain commands define `remote end definition` fragments. These provide choices in the `CommandData` group for the module’s commands, and can also define additional definition properties. They can also define `local end definition` fragments that provide additional choices in the `ResultData` group for the results of commands in the module.

Modules which contain events define `local end definition` fragments that are choices in the `Event` group for the module’s events.

An implementation may define extension modules. These must have a module name that contains a single colon "`:`" character. The part before the colon is the prefix; this is typically the same for all extension modules specific to a given implementation and should be unique for a given implementation.

Other specifications may define their own WebDriver-BiDi modules that extend the protocol. Such modules must not have a name which contains a colon (`:`) character, nor must they define command names, event names, or property names that contain that character.

Authors of external specifications are encouraged to to add new modules rather than extending existing ones. Where it is desired to extend an existing module, it is preferred to integrate the extension directly into the specification containing the original module definition.

### 3.4. Commands

A command is an asynchronous operation, requested by the local end and run on the remote end, resulting in either a result or an error being returned to the local end. Multiple commands can run at the same time, and commands can potentially be long-running. As a consequence, commands can finish out-of-order.

Each command is defined by:

-   A command type which is defined by a `remote end definition` fragment containing a group. Each such group has two fields:
    
    -   `method` which is a string literal of the form `[module name].[method name]`. This is the command name.
        
    -   `params` which defines a mapping containing data that to be passed into the command. The populated value of this map is the command parameters.
        
-   A result type, which is defined by a `local end definition` fragment.
    
-   A set of remote end steps which define the actions to take for a command given a BiDi session and command parameters and return an instance of the command result type.
    

A command that can run without an active session is a static command. Commands are not static commands unless stated in their definition.

When commands are sent from the local end they have a command id. This is an identifier used by the local end to identify the response from a particular command. From the point of view of the remote end this identifier is opaque and cannot be used internally to identify the command.

Note: This is because the command id is entirely controlled by the local end and isn’t necessarily unique over the course of a session. For example a local end which ignores all responses could use the same command id for each command.

The set of all command names is a set containing all the defined command names, including any belonging to extension modules.

### 3.5. Errors

WebDriver BiDi extends the set of error codes from WebDriver with the following additional codes:

### 3.6. Events

An event is a notification, sent by the remote end to the local end, signaling that something of interest has occurred on the remote end.

-   An event type is defined by a `local end definition` fragment containing a group. Each such group has two fields:
    
    -   `method` which is a string literal of the form `[module name].[event name]`. This is the event name.
        
    -   `params` which defines a mapping containing event data. The populated value of this map is the event parameters.
        
-   A remote end event trigger which defines when the event is triggered and steps to construct the event type data.
    
-   Optionally, a set of remote end subscribe steps, which define steps to take when a local end subscribes to an event. Where defined these steps have an associated subscribe priority which is an integer controlling the order in which the steps are run when multiple events are enabled at once, with lower integers indicating steps that run earlier.
    

A BiDi session has subscriptions which is a list of subscriptions.

A BiDi session has a known subscription ids which is a set of all subscription ids that have been issued to the local end but which have not yet been unsubscribed.

A subscription is a struct consisting of a subscription id (a string), event names (a set of event names), top-level traversable ids (a set of IDs of top-level traversables) and user context ids (a set of IDs of user contexts).

A subscription subscription is global if subscription’s top-level traversable ids is an empty set and subscription’s user context ids is an empty set.

The set of sessions for which an event is enabled given event name and navigables is:

1.  Let sessions be a new set.
    
2.  For each session in active BiDi sessions:
    
    1.  If event is enabled with session, event name and navigables, append session to sessions.
        
3.  Return sessions.
    

To determine if an event is enabled given session, event name and navigables:

Note: navigables is a set because a shared worker can be associated with multiple contexts.

1.  Let top-level traversables be get top-level traversables with navigables.
    
2.  For each subscription in session’s subscriptions:
    
    1.  If subscription’s event names do not contains event name, continue.
        
    2.  If subscription is global return true.
        
    3.  If user context ids is not empty:
        
        1.  For each navigable in top-level traversables:
            
            1.  If subscription’s user context ids contains navigable’s associated user context’s user context id, return true.
                
    4.  Otherwise:
        
        1.  Let subscription top-level traversables be get navigables by ids with subscription’s top-level traversable ids.
            
        2.  If the intersection of top-level traversables and subscription top-level traversables is not empty return true.
            
3.  Return false.
    

The set of top-level traversables for which an event is enabled given event name and session is:

1.  Let result be a new set.
    
2.  For each subscription in session’s subscriptions:
    
    1.  If subscription’s event names does not contain event name, continue.
        
    2.  If subscription’s is global:
        
        1.  For each traversable in remote end’s top-level traversables:
            
            1.  Append traversable to result.
                
        2.  Break.
            
    3.  Otherwise, if user context ids is not empty:
        
        1.  For each traversable in remote end’s top-level traversables:
            
            1.  Append traversable to result if subscription’s user context ids contains traversable’s associated user context’s user context id.
                
    4.  Otherwise:
        
        1.  Let top-level traversables be get navigables by ids with subscription’s top-level traversable ids.
            
        2.  Append each item of top-level traversables to result.
            
3.  Return result.
    

To obtain a set of event names given a name:

1.  Let events be an empty set.
    
2.  If name contains a U+002E (period):
    
    1.  If name is the event name for an event, append name to events and return success with data events.
        
    2.  Return an error with error code invalid argument
        
3.  Otherwise name is interpreted as representing all the events in a module. If name is not a module name return an error with error code invalid argument.
    
4.  Append the event name for each event in the module with name name to events.
    
5.  Return success with data events.
    

## 4\. Transport

Message transport is provided using the WebSocket protocol. \[RFC6455\]

Note: In the terms of the WebSocket protocol, the local end is the client and the remote end is the server / remote host.

Note: The encoding of commands and events as messages is similar to JSON-RPC, but this specification does not normatively reference it. \[JSON-RPC\] The normative requirements on remote ends are instead given as a precise processing model, while no normative requirements are given for local ends.

A WebSocket listener is a network endpoint that is able to accept incoming WebSocket connections.

A WebSocket listener has a host, a port, a secure flag, and a list of WebSocket resources.

When a WebSocket listener listener is created, a remote end must start to listen for WebSocket connections on the host and port given by listener’s host and port. If listener’s secure flag is set, then connections established from listener must be TLS encrypted.

A remote end has a set of WebSocket listeners active listeners, which is initially empty.

A remote end has a set of WebSocket connections not associated with a session, which is initially empty.

A WebSocket connection is a network connection that follows the requirements of the WebSocket protocol

A BiDi session has a set of session WebSocket connections whose elements are WebSocket connections. This is initially empty.

A BiDi session session is associated with connection connection if session’s session WebSocket connections contains connection.

Note: Each WebSocket connection is associated with at most one BiDi session.

When a client establishes a WebSocket connection connection by connecting to one of the set of active listeners listener, the implementation must proceed according to the WebSocket server-side requirements, with the following steps run when deciding whether to accept the incoming connection:

1.  Let resource name be the resource name from reading the client’s opening handshake. If resource name is not in listener’s list of WebSocket resources, then stop running these steps and act as if the requested service is not available.
    
2.  If resource name is the byte string "`/session`", and the implementation supports BiDi-only sessions:
    
    1.  Run any other implementation-defined steps to decide if the connection should be accepted, and if it is not stop running these steps and act as if the requested service is not available.
        
    2.  Add the connection to WebSocket connections not associated with a session.
        
    3.  Return.
        
3.  Get a session ID for a WebSocket resource with resource name and let session id be that value. If session id is null then stop running these steps and act as if the requested service is not available.
    
4.  If there is a session in the list of active sessions with session id as its session ID then let session be that session. Otherwise stop running these steps and act as if the requested service is not available.
    
5.  Run any other implementation-defined steps to decide if the connection should be accepted, and if it is not stop running these steps and act as if the requested service is not available.
    
6.  Otherwise append connection to session’s session WebSocket connections, and proceed with the WebSocket server-side requirements when a server chooses to accept an incoming connection.
    

Do we support > 1 connection for a single session?

When a WebSocket message has been received for a WebSocket connection connection with type type and data data, a remote end must handle an incoming message given connection, type and data.

When the WebSocket closing handshake is started or when the WebSocket connection is closed for a WebSocket connection connection, a remote end must handle a connection closing given connection.

Note: Both conditions are needed because it is possible for a WebSocket connection to be closed without a closing handshake.

To construct a WebSocket resource name given a session session:

1.  If session is null, return "`/session`"
    
2.  Return the result of concatenating the string "`/session/`" with session’s session ID.
    

To construct a WebSocket URL given a WebSocket listener listener and session session:

1.  Let resource name be the result of construct a WebSocket resource name with session.
    
2.  Return a WebSocket URI constructed with host set to listener’s host, port set to listener’s port, path set to resource name, following the wss-URI construct if listener’s secure flag is set and the ws-URL construct otherwise.
    

To get a session ID for a WebSocket resource given resource name:

1.  If resource name doesn’t begin with the byte string "`/session/`", return null.
    
2.  Let session id be the bytes in resource name following the "`/session/`" prefix.
    
3.  If session id is not the string representation of a UUID, return null.
    
4.  Return session id.
    

To start listening for a WebSocket connection given a session session:

1.  If there is an existing WebSocket listener in active listeners which the remote end would like to reuse, let listener be that listener. Otherwise let listener be a new WebSocket listener with implementation-defined host, port, secure flag, and an empty list of WebSocket resources.
    
2.  Let resource name be the result of construct a WebSocket resource name with session.
    
3.  Append resource name to the list of WebSocket resources for listener.
    
4.  Append listener to the remote end’s active listeners.
    
5.  Return listener.
    

Note: An intermediary node handling multiple sessions can use one or many WebSocket listeners. WebDriver defines that an endpoint node supports at most one session at a time, so it’s expected to only have a single listener.

Note: For an endpoint node the host in the above steps will typically be "`localhost`".

To handle an incoming message given a WebSocket connection connection, type type and data data:

1.  If type is not text, send an error response given connection, null, and invalid argument, and finally return.
    
2.  Assert: data is a scalar value string, because the WebSocket handling errors in UTF-8-encoded data would already have failed the WebSocket connection otherwise.
    
    Nothing seems to define what status code is used for UTF-8 errors.
    
3.  If there is a BiDi Session associated with connection connection, let session be that session. Otherwise if connection is in WebSocket connections not associated with a session, let session be null. Otherwise, return.
    
4.  Let parsed be the result of parsing JSON into Infra values given data. If this throws an exception, then send an error response given connection, null, and invalid argument, and finally return.
    
5.  If session is not null and not in active sessions then return.
    
6.  Match parsed against the `remote end definition`. If this results in a match:
    
    1.  Let matched be the map representing the matched data.
        
    2.  Assert: matched contains "`id`", "`method`", and "`params`".
        
    3.  Let command id be matched\["`id`"\].
        
    4.  Let method be matched\["`method`"\]
        
    5.  Let command be the command with command name method.
        
    6.  If session is null and command is not a static command, then send an error response given connection, command id, and invalid session id, and return.
        
    7.  Run the following steps in parallel:
        
        1.  Let result be the result of running the remote end steps for command given session and command parameters matched\["`params`"\]
            
        2.  If result is an error, then send an error response given connection, command id, and result’s error code, and finally return.
            
        3.  Let value be result’s data.
            
        4.  Assert: value matches the definition for the result type corresponding to the command with command name method.
            
        5.  If method is "`session.new`", let session be the entry in the list of active sessions whose session ID is equal to the "`sessionId`" property of value, append connection to session’s session WebSocket connections, and remove connection from the WebSocket connections not associated with a session.
            
        6.  Let response be a new map matching the `CommandResponse` production in the `local end definition` with the `id` field set to command id and the `value` field set to value.
            
        7.  Let serialized be the result of serialize an infra value to JSON bytes given response.
            
        8.  Send a WebSocket message comprised of serialized over connection.
            
7.  Otherwise:
    
    1.  Let command id be null.
        
    2.  If parsed is a map and parsed\["`id`"\] exists and is an integer greater than or equal to zero, set command id to that integer.
        
    3.  Let error code be invalid argument.
        
    4.  If parsed is a map and parsed\["`method`"\] exists and is a string, but parsed\["`method`"\] is not in the set of all command names, set error code to unknown command.
        
    5.  Send an error response given connection, command id, and error code.
        

To given an settings object settings:

1.  Let related navigables be an empty set.
    
2.  If settings’ relevant global object is a `Window`:
    
    1.  Let navigable be relevant global object’s associated `Document`’s node navigable.
        
    2.  If navigable is not null, append navigable to related navigables.
        
3.  Otherwise if the global object specified by settings is a `WorkerGlobalScope`, for each owner in the global object’s owner set:
    
    1.  Let navigable be null.
        
    2.  If owner is a Document, set navigable to owner’s node navigable.
        
    3.  If navigable is not null, append navigable to related navigables.
        
4.  Return related navigables.
    

To get navigables by ids given a list of context ids navigable ids:

1.  Let result be an empty set.
    
2.  For each navigable id in navigable ids:
    
    1.  Let navigable be the navigable with id navigable id if such navigable exists, and null otherwise.
        
    2.  Append navigable to result if navigable is not null.
        
3.  Return result.
    

To get top-level traversables given a list of navigables navigables:

1.  Let result be an empty set.

    1.  Append navigable’s top-level traversable to result.
        
3.  Return result.
    

To get valid navigables by ids given a list of context ids navigable ids:

1.  Let result be an empty set.
    
2.  For each navigable id in navigable ids:
    
    1.  Let navigable be the result of trying to get a navigable with navigable id.
        
    2.  Append navigable to result.
        
3.  Return success with data result.

    3.  Append navigable to result.
        
3.  Return success with data result.
    

To emit an event given session, and body:

1.  Assert: body matches the `Event` production.
    
2.  Let serialized be the result of serialize an infra value to JSON bytes given body.
    
3.  For each connection in session’s session WebSocket connections:

To send an error response given a WebSocket connection connection, command id, and error code:

1.  Let error data be a new map matching the `ErrorResponse` production in the `local end definition`, with the `id` field set to command id, the `error` field set to error code, the `message` field set to an implementation-defined string containing a human-readable definition of the error that occurred and the `stacktrace` field optionally set to an implementation-defined string containing a stack trace report of the active stack frames at the time when the error occurred.
    
2.  Let response be the result of serialize an infra value to JSON bytes given error data.
    
    Note: command id can be null, in which case the `id` field will also be set to null, not omitted from response.
    
3.  Send a WebSocket message comprised of response over connection.
    

To handle a connection closing given a WebSocket connection connection:

1.  If there is a BiDi session associated with connection connection:
    
    1.  Let session be the BiDi session associated with connection connection.
        
    2.  Remove connection from session’s session WebSocket connections.
        
2.  Otherwise, if WebSocket connections not associated with a session contains connection, remove connection from that set.
    

Note: This does not end any session.

Need to hook in to the session ending to allow the UA to close the listener if it wants.

To close the WebSocket connections given session:

1.  For each connection in session’s session WebSocket connections:
    
    1.  Start the WebSocket closing handshake with connection.
        
        Note: this will result in the steps in handle a connection closing being run for connection, which will clean up resources associated with connection.
        

### 4.1. Establishing a Connection

WebDriver clients opt in to a bidirectional connection by requesting the WebSocket URL capability with value true.

The WebDriver new session algorithm defined by this specification, with parameters session, capabilities, and flags is:

1.  If flags contains "`bidi`", return.
    
2.  Let webSocketUrl be the result of getting a property named "`webSocketUrl`" from capabilities.
    
3.  If webSocketUrl is undefined, return.
    
4.  Assert: webSocketUrl is true.
    
5.  Let listener be the result of start listening for a WebSocket connection given session.
    
6.  Set webSocketUrl to the result of construct a WebSocket URL with listener and session.
    
7.  Set a property on capabilities named "`webSocketUrl`" to webSocketUrl.
    
8.  Set session’s BiDi flag to true.
    
9.  Append "`bidi`" to flags.
    

Implementations should also allow clients to establish a BiDi Session which is not a HTTP Session. In this case the URL to the WebSocket server is communicated out-of-band. An implementation that allows this supports BiDi-only sessions. At the time such an implementation is ready to accept requests to start a WebDriver session, it must:

1.  Start listening for a WebSocket connection given null.
    

## 5\. Sandboxed Script Execution

A common requirement for automation tools is to execute scripts which have access to the DOM of a document, but don’t have information about any changes to the DOM APIs made by scripts running in the navigable containing the document.

A BiDi session has a sandbox map which is a weak map in which the keys are `Window` objects, and the values are maps between strings and `SandboxWindowProxy` objects.

Note: The definition of sandboxes here is an attempt to codify the behaviour of existing implementations. It exposes parts of the implementations that have previously been considered internal by specifications, in particular the distinction between the internal state of platform objects (which is typically implemented as native objects in the main implementation language of the browser engine) and the ECMAScript-visible state. Because existing sandbox implementations happen at a low level in the engine, implementations converging toward the specification in all details might be a slow process. In the meantime, implementers are encouraged to provide detailed documentation on any differences with the specification, and users of this feature are encouraged to explicitly test that scripts running in sandboxes work in all implementations.

### 5.1. Sandbox Realms

Each sandbox is a unique ECMAScript Realm. However the sandbox realm provides access to platform objects in an existing `Window` realm via `SandboxProxy` objects.

To get or create a sandbox realm given name and navigable:

1.  If name is an empty string, then return error with error code invalid argument.
    
2.  Let window be navigable’s active window.
    
3.  If sandbox map does not contain window, set sandbox map\[window\] to a new map.
    
4.  Let sandboxes be sandbox map\[window\].
    
5.  If sandboxes does not contain name, set sandboxes\[name\] to create a sandbox realm with navigable.
    
6.  Return success with data sandboxes\[name\].
    

To create a sandbox realm with window:

Define creation of sandbox realm. This is going to return a `SandboxWindowProxy` wrapping window.

To get a sandbox name given target realm:

1.  Let realms maps be get the values of sandbox map.
    
2.  For each realms map in realms maps:
    
    1.  For each name → realm in realms map:
        
        1.  If realm is target realm, return name.
            
3.  Return null.
    

### 5.2. Sandbox Proxy Objects

A `SandboxProxy` object is an exotic object that mediates sandboxed access to objects from another realm. Sandbox proxy objects are designed to enforce the following restrictions:

-   Platform objects are accessible, but property access returns only Web IDL-defined properties and not ECMAScript-defined properties (either "expando" properties that are not present in the underlying interface, or ECMAScript-defined properties that shadow a property in the underlying interface).
    
-   Setting a property either runs Web IDL-defined setter steps, or sets a property on the proxy object. This means that properties written outside the sandbox are not accessible, but interface members can be used as normal.
    

There is no `SandboxProxy` interface object.

Define in detail how `SandboxProxy` works

To get unwrapped object:

1.  While object is `SandboxProxy` or `SandboxWindowProxy`, set object to it’s wrapped object.
    
2.  Return object.
    

### 5.3. SandboxWindowProxy

A `SandboxWindowProxy` is an exotic object that represents a `Window` object wrapped by a `SandboxProxy` object. This provides sandboxed access to that data in a `Window` global.

Define how this works.

## 6\. User Contexts

A user context represents a collection of zero or more top-level traversables within a remote end. Each user context has an associated storage partition, so that remote end data is not shared between different user contexts.

Unclear that this is the best way to formally define the concept of a user context or the interaction with storage.

Note: The infra spec uses the term "user agent" to refer to the same concept as user contexts. However, this is not compatible with usage of the term "user agent" to mean the entire web client with multiple user contexts. Although this difference is not visible to web content, it is observed via WebDriver, so we avoid using this terminology.

A user context has a user context id, which is a unique string set upon the user context creation.

A navigable has an associated user context, which is a user context.

When a new top-level traversable is created its associated user context is set to a user context in the set of user contexts.

Note: In some cases the user context is set by specification when the top-level traversable is created, however in cases where no such requirements are present, the associated user context for a top-level traversable is implemenation-defined.

Should we specify that top-level traversables with a non-null opener have the same associated user context as their opener? Need to check if this is something existing implementations enforce.

A child navigable’s associated user context is it’s parent’s associated user context.

A user context which isn’t the associated user context for any top-level traversable is an empty user context.

The default user context is a user context with user context id `"default"`.

An implementation has a set of user contexts, which is a set of user contexts. Initially this contains the default user context.

Implementations may append new user contexts to the set of user contexts at any time, for example in response to user actions.

Note: "At any time" here includes during implementation startup, so a given implementation might always have multiple entries in the set of user contexts.

Implementations may remove any empty user context, with exception of the default user context, from the set of user contexts at any time. However they are not required to remove such user contexts. User contexts that are not empty user contexts must not be removed from the set of user contexts.

A BiDi session has a user context to accept insecure certificates override map, which is a map between user contexts and boolean.

A BiDi session has a user context to proxy configuration map, which is a map between user contexts and proxy configuration.

An emulated network conditions struct is a struct with:

-   item named offline which is a boolean or null.
    

A BiDi session has a emulated network conditions which is a struct with an item named default network conditions, which is an emulated network conditions struct or null, an item named user context network conditions, which is a weak map between user contexts and emulated network conditions struct, and a item named navigable network conditions, which is a weak map between navigables and emulated network conditions struct.

When a user context is removed from the set of user contexts, remove user context subscriptions.

To remove user context subscriptions:

1.  For each session in active sessions:
    
    1.  Let subscriptions to remove be a set.
        
    2.  For each subscription in session’s subscriptions:
        
        1.  If subscription’s user context ids contains navigable’s associated user context’s user context id;
            
            1.  Remove navigable’s associated user context’s user context id from subscription’s user context ids.
                
            2.  If subscription’s user context ids is empty:
                
                1.  Append subscription to subscriptions to remove.
                    
    3.  Remove subscriptions to remove from session’s subscriptions.
        

To get user context given user context id:

1.  For each user context in the set of user contexts:
    
2.  If user context’s user context id equals user context id:
    
    1.  Return user context.
        
3.  Return null.
    

To get valid user contexts given user context ids:

1.  Let result be an empty set.
    
2.  For each user context id of user context ids:
    
    1.  Set user context to get user context with user context id.
        
    2.  If user context is null, return error with error code no such user context.
        
    3.  Append user context to result.
        
3.  Return result.

##### 7.1.3.1. The session.status Command

The session.status command returns information about whether a remote end is in a state in which it can create new sessions, but may additionally include arbitrary meta information that is specific to the implementation.

This is a static command.

Command Type

```
session.Status
```

Return Type

```
session.StatusResult
```

##### 7.1.3.2. The session.new Command

The session.new command allows creating a new BiDi session.

Note: A session created this way will not be accessible via HTTP.

This is a static command.

Command Type

```
session.New
```

Return Type

```
session.NewResult
```

The remote end steps given session and command parameters are:

1.  If session is not null, return an error with error code session not created.
    
2.  If the implementation is unable to start a new session for any reason, return an error with error code session not created.

6.  Let session be the result of trying to create a session with capabilities and flags.
    
7.  Set session’s BiDi flag to true.
    
    Note: the connection for this session will be set to the current connection by the caller.
    
8.  Let body be a new map matching the `session.NewResult` production, with the `sessionId` field set to session’s session ID, and the `capabilities` field set to capabilities.

1.  End the session with session.
    
2.  Return success with data null, and in parallel run the following steps:
    
    1.  Wait until the Send a WebSocket message steps have been called with the response to this command.
        
        this is rather imprecise language, but hopefully it’s clear that the intent is that we send the response to the command before starting shutdown of the connections.
        
    2.  Cleanup the session with session.
        

##### 7.1.3.4. The session.subscribe Command

The session.subscribe command enables certain events either globally or for a set of navigables.

This needs to be generalized to work with realms too.

Command Type

```
session.Subscribe

Return Type

```
session.SubscribeResult
```

The remote end steps with session and command parameters are:

1.  Let event names be an empty set.

9.  Otherwise, if input user context ids is not empty:
    
    1.  For each user context id of input user context ids:
        
        1.  Let user context be get user context with user context id.
            
        2.  If user context is null, return error with error code no such user context.
            
        3.  For each top-level traversable in the list of all top-level traversables whose associated user context is user context:
            
            1.  Append top-level traversable to subscription navigables.

11.  Let subscription be a subscription with subscription id set to the string representation of a UUID, event names set to event names, top-level traversable ids set to top-level traversable context ids and user context ids set to input user context ids.
     
12.  Let subscribe step events be a new map.
     
13.  For each event name in the event names:
     
     1.  If the event with event name event name does not define remote end subscribe steps, continue;
         
     2.  Let existing navigables be a set of top-level traversables for which an event is enabled with session and event name.

19.  Let body be a new map matching the `session.SubscribeResult` production, with the `subscription` field set to subscription’s subscription id.
     
20.  Return success with data body.
     

##### 7.1.3.5. The session.unsubscribe Command

The session.unsubscribe command disables events either globally or for a set of navigables.

This needs to be generalised to work with realms too.

Command Type

```
session.Unsubscribe
```

Return Type

```
session.UnsubscribeResult
```

The remote end steps with session and command parameters are:

1.  If command parameters does not contain "`subscriptions`":
    
    Note: The condition implies that command parameters is matching the session.UnsubscribeByAttributesRequest production.
    
    1.  Let event names be an empty set.
        
    2.  For each entry name in command parameters\["`events`"\], let event names be the union of event names and the result of trying to obtain a set of event names with name.

            1.  append subscription to new subscriptions.
                
            2.  Continue.
                
        2.  If subscription is not global:
            
            1.  append subscription to new subscriptions.
                
            2.  Continue.
                
        3.  Let subscription event names be clone of subscription’s event names.
            
        4.  For each event name of event names:
            
            1.  If subscription event names contains event name:
                
                1.  Append event name to matched events.

2.  Otherwise:
    
    1.  Let subscriptions be create a set with command parameters\[`subscriptions`\].
        
    2.  Let unknown subscription ids to difference between subscriptions and session’s known subscription ids.
        
    3.  If unknown subscription ids is not empty:
        
        1.  Return error with error code invalid argument.
            
    4.  Let subscriptions to remove be an empty set.
        
    5.  For each subscription in session’s subscriptions:
        
        1.  If subscriptions contains subscription’s subscription id:
            
            1.  Append subscription to subscriptions to remove.
                
    6.  Set session’s known subscription ids to difference between session’s known subscription ids and subscriptions.
        
    7.  Remove each item in subscriptions to remove from session’s subscriptions.
        
3.  Return success with data null.
    

### 7.2. The browser Module

The browser module contains commands for managing the remote end browser process.

#### 7.2.1. Definition

`remote end definition`

```
BrowserCommand
```

`local end definition`

```
BrowserResult
```

#### 7.2.2. Windows

Each top-level traversable is associated with a single client window which represents a rectangular area containing the viewport that will be used to render that top-level traversable’s active document when its visibility state is "`visible`", as well as any browser-specific user interface elements associated with displaying the traversable (e.g. any URL bar, toolbars, or OS window decorations).

A client window has a client window id which is a string uniquely identifying that window.

A client window has an x-coordinate, which is the number of CSS pixels between the left edge of the web-exposed screen area and the left edge of the window, or zero if that doesn’t make sense for a particular window.

A client window has a y-coordinate, which is the number of CSS pixels between the top edge of the web-exposed screen area and the top edge of the window, or zero if that doesn’t make sense for a particular window.

A client window has a width, which is the width of the window’s rectangle in CSS pixels.

A client window has a height, which is the height of the window’s rectangle in CSS pixels.

To maximize the client window window an implementation should either perform steps corresponding to the platform notion of maximizing window, or position window such that its x-coordinate is as close as possible to 0, its y-coordinate is as close as possible to 0, its width is as close as possible to the width of the web-exposed screen area and its height is as close as possible to the height of the web-exposed screen area. If either of these options are supported then maximize client window is supported.

To minimize the client window window an implementation should either perform steps corresponding to the platform notion of minimizing window, or otherwise hide window such that all the active documents in top-level traversables associated with window have visibility state "`hidden`" and window’s width and height are both as close as possible to 0. If either of these options are supported then minimize client window is supported.

To restore the client window window an implementation should ensure that it’s neither in a platform-defined maximized state, nor in a platform-defined minimized state, and that if there is one or more top-level traversable associated with window, at least one of those has an active document in the "`visible`" state. If this is supported then restore client window is supported.

To get the client window state given window:

1.  Let documents be an empty list.
    
2.  Let visible documents be an empty list.
    
3.  For each top-level traversable traversable:
    
    1.  If traversable’s client window is not window then continue.
        
    2.  Let document be traversable’s active document.

#### 7.2.4. Commands

##### 7.2.4.1. The browser.close Command

The browser.close command terminates all WebDriver sessions and cleans up automation state in the remote browser instance.

Command Type

```
browser.Close
```

Return Type

```
browser.CloseResult
```

The remote end steps with session and command parameters are:

1.  End the session with session.
    
2.  If active sessions is not empty an implementation may return error with error code unable to close browser, and then run the following steps in parallel:
    
    1.  Wait until the Send a WebSocket message steps have been called with the response to this command.
        
    2.  Cleanup the session with session.
        
    
    Note: The behaviour in cases where the browser has multiple automation sessions is currently unspecified. It might be that any session can close the browser, or that only the final open session can actually close the browser, or only the first session started can. This behaviour might be fully specified in a future version of this specification.
    
3.  For each active session in active sessions:
    
    1.  End the session active session.
        
    2.  Cleanup the session with active session
        
4.  Return success with data null, and run the following steps in parallel.
    
    1.  Wait until the Send a WebSocket message steps have been called with the response to this command.
        
    2.  Cleanup the session with session.
        
    3.  Close any top-level traversables without prompting to unload.
        
    4.  Perform implementation defined steps to clean up resources associated with the remote end under automation.
        
        Note: For example this might include cleanly shutting down any OS-level processes associated with the browser under automation, removing temporary state, such as user profile data, created by the remote end while under automation, or shutting down the WebSocket Listener. Because of differences between browsers and operating systems it is not possible to specify in detail precise invariants local ends can depend on here.

### 7.3. The browsingContext Module

The browsingContext module contains commands and events relating to navigables.

Note: For historic reasons this module is called `browsingContext` rather than `navigable`, and the protocol uses the term `context` to refer to navigables, particularly as a field in command and response parameters.

The progress of navigation is communicated using an immutable struct WebDriver BiDi navigation status, which has the following items:

id

The navigation id for the navigation, or null when the navigation is canceled before making progress.

status

A status code that is either "`canceled`", "`pending`", or "`complete`".

url

The URL which is being loaded in the navigation

suggestedFilename

If the navigation is a download, suggested filename, otherwise null.

downloadedFilepath

If the navigation is a download which is finished and the downloaded file is available, absolute filepath of the downloaded file, otherwise null.

#### 7.3.1. Definition

```
BrowsingContextCommand
```

`local end definition`

```

```

A remote end has a device pixel ratio overrides which is a weak map between navigables and device pixel ratio overrides. It is initially empty.

Note: this map is not cleared when the final session ends i.e. device pixel ratio overrides outlive any WebDriver session.

A viewport dimensions is a struct with:

-   Item named height which is an integer;
    
-   Item named width which is an integer.
    

A viewport configuration is a struct with:

-   Item named viewport which is a viewport dimensions or null;
    
-   Item named devicePixelRatio which is a float or null.
    

An unhandled prompt behavior struct is a struct with:

-   Item named `alert` which is a string or null;
    
-   Item named `beforeUnload` which is a string or null;
    
-   Item named `confirm` which is a string or null;
    
-   Item named `default` which is a string or null;
    
-   Item named `file` which is a string or null;
    
-   Item named `prompt` which is a string or null.
    

A remote end has a viewport overrides map which is a weak map between user contexts and viewport configuration.

A remote end has a locale overrides map which is a weak map between navigables or user contexts and string.

A screen settings is a struct with an item named `height` which is an integer, an item named `width` which is an integer, an item named `x` which is an integer, an item named `y` which is an integer.

A remote end has a screen settings overrides which is a struct with an item named user context screen settings, which is a weak map between user contexts and screen settings, and an item named navigable screen settings, which is a weak map between navigables and screen settings.

A remote end has a timezone overrides map which is a weak map between navigables or user contexts and string.

A remote end has an unhandled prompt behavior overrides map which is a weak map between user contexts and unhandled prompt behavior struct.

A remote end has a scripting enabled overrides map which is a weak map between navigables or user contexts and boolean.

12.  Let navigable info be a map matching the `browsingContext.Info` production with the `context` field set to navigable id, the `parent` field set to parent id if include parent id is `true`, or unset otherwise, the `url` field set to url, the `userContext` field set to user context’s user context id, `originalOpener` field set to opener id, the `children` field set to child infos, and the `clientWindow` field set to client window id.
     
13.  Return navigable info.
     

To await a navigation given navigable, request, wait condition, and optionally history handling (default: "`default`") and ignore cache (default: false):

1.  Let navigation id be the string representation of a UUID based on truly random, or pseudo-random numbers.
    
2.  Navigate navigable with resource request, and using navigable’s active document as the source `Document`, with navigation id navigation id, and history handling behavior history handling. If ignore cache is true, the navigation must not load resources from the HTTP cache.
    
    property specify how the ignore cache flag works. This needs to consider whether only the first load of a resource bypasses the cache (i.e. whether this is like initially clearing the cache and proceeding like normal), or whether resources not directly loaded by the HTML parser (e.g. loads initiated by scripts or stylesheets) also bypass the cache.
    
3.  Let (event received, navigation status) be await given «"`navigation started`", "`navigation failed`", "`fragment navigated`"», and navigation id.
    
4.  Assert: navigation status’s id is navigation id.

    1.  Let body be a map matching the `browsingContext.NavigateResult` production, with the `navigation` field set to navigation id, and the `url` field set to the result of the URL serializer given navigation status’s url.
        
    2.  Return success with data body.
        
    
    Note: this is the case if the navigation only caused the fragment to change.
    
6.  If navigation status’s status is "`canceled`" return error with error code unknown error.
    
    TODO: is this the right way to handle errors here?
    
7.  Assert: navigation status’s status is "`pending`" and navigation id is not null.
    
8.  If wait condition is "`committed`", let event name be "`committed`".
    
9.  Otherwise, if wait condition is "`interactive`", let event name be "`domContentLoaded`".
    
10.  Otherwise, let event name be "`load`".
     
11.  Let (event received, status) be await given «event name, "`download started`", "`navigation aborted`", "`navigation failed`"» and navigation id.
     
12.  If event received is "`navigation failed`" return error with error code unknown error.
     
     Are we surfacing enough information about what failed and why with an error here? What error code do we want? Is there going to be a problem where local ends parse the implementation-defined strings to figure out what actually went wrong?
     
13.  Let body be a map matching the `browsingContext.NavigateResult` production, with the `navigation` field set to status’s id, and the `url` field set to the result of the URL serializer given status’s url.

1.  Run implementation-specific steps so that navigable’s system visibility state becomes visible. If this is not possible return error with error code unsupported operation.
    
    Note: This can have the side effect of making currently visible navigables hidden.
    
    Note: This can change the underlying OS state by causing the window to become unminimized or by other side effects related to changing the system visibility state.
    
2.  Run implementation-specific steps to set the system focus on the navigable if it is not focused.
    
    Note: This does not change the focused area of the document except as mandated by other specifications.

### 7.5. The network Module

The network module contains commands and events relating to network requests.

#### 7.5.1. Definition

`remote end definition`

```
NetworkCommand
```

`local end definition`

```
NetworkResult
```

A remote end has a before request sent map which is initially an empty map. It’s used to track the network events for which a `network.beforeRequestSent` event has already been sent.

A remote end has a default cache behavior which is a string. It is initially "`default`".

A remote end has a navigable cache behavior map which is a weak map between top-level traversables and strings representing cache behavior. It is initially empty.

A BiDi session has a which is a struct with an item named , which is a header list (initially set to an empty header list), an item named , which is a weak map between user contexts and header lists, and a item named , which is a weak map between navigables and header lists.

#### 7.5.2. Network Data Collection

A network data is a struct with:

-   Item named bytes, which is a `network.BytesValue` or null,
    
-   Item named cloned body, which is a body or null,
    
-   Item named collectors, which is a list of `network.Collector`,
    
-   Item named pending, which is a boolean,
    
-   Item named request, which is a request id,
    
-   Item named size, which is a js-uint or null,
    
-   Item named type, which is a `network.DataType`.
    

A collector is a struct with:

-   Item named max encoded item size, which is a js-uint;
    
-   item named contexts, which is a list of navigable id;
    
-   item named data types, which is a list of `network.DataType`;
    
-   item named collector, which is a `network.Collector`;
    
-   item named collector type, which is a `network.CollectorType`;
    
-   item named user contexts, which is a list of `browser.UserContext`.
    

Note: max encoded item size defines the limit per item (response or request), and does not limit the size collected by the specific collector. The total size of all collected resources is limited by max total collected size.

A BiDi session has network collectors which is a map between `network.Collector` and a collector. It is initially empty.

A remote end has collected network data which is a list of network data. It is initially empty.

A remote end has a max total collected size which is a js-uint representing the size allocated to collect network data in collected network data. Its value is implementation-defined.

Note: This allows implementations to set resource usage limits. It is expected that the limits are sufficiently large that users can depend on collecting data that is fully decoded and handled by the browser, such as images and fonts used on a webpage.

To get navigable for request given request:

1.  Let navigable be null.
    
2.  If request’s client is an environment settings object:
    
    1.  Let environment settings be request’s client
        
    2.  If there is a navigable whose active window is environment settings’ global object, set navigable to be that navigable.
        
3.  Return navigable.
    

To match collector for navigable given collector and navigable:

1.  If collector’s contexts is not empty:
    
    1.  If collector’s contexts contains navigable’s navigable id, return true.
        
    2.  Otherwise, return false.
        
2.  If collector’s user contexts is not empty:
    
    1.  Let user context be navigable’s associated user context.
        
    2.  If collector’s user contexts contains user context’s user context id, return true.
        
    3.  Otherwise, return false.
        
3.  Return true.
    

The WebDriver BiDi clone network request body steps given request request are:

1.  If request’s body is null, return.
    
2.  For each session in active BiDi sessions:
    
    1.  If session’s network collectors is not empty:
        
        1.  Let collected data be a network data with bytes set to null, cloned body set to clone of request’s body, collectors set to an empty list, pending set to true, request set to request’s request id, size set to null, type set to "request".
            
        2.  Append collected data to collected network data.
            
        3.  Return.
            

The WebDriver BiDi clone network response body steps given request and response body are:

1.  If response body is null, return.
    
2.  For each session in active BiDi sessions:
    
    1.  If session’s network collectors is not empty:
        
        1.  Let collected data be a network data with bytes set to null, cloned body set to clone of response body, collectors set to an empty list, pending set to true, request set to request’s request id, size set to null, type set to "response".
            
        2.  Append collected data to collected network data.
            
        3.  Return.
            

To get collected data given request id and data type.

1.  For collected data of collected network data:
    
    1.  If collected data’s request is request id and collected data’s type is data type, return collected data.
        
2.  Return null.
    

To maybe abort network response body collection given request:

1.  Let collected data be get collected data with request’s request id and "response".
    
2.  If collected data is null, return.
    
3.  Set collected data’s pending to false.
    
4.  Resume with "`network data collected`" and (request’s request id, "response").
    

To maybe collect network request body given request:

1.  Let collected data be get collected data with request’s request id and "request".
    
2.  If collected data is null, return.
    
    NOTE: This might happen if there are no collectors setup when the request is created, and WebDriver BiDi clone network request body does not clone the corresponding body. Or if the body was null in the first place.
    
3.  Maybe collect network data with request, collected data, null and "request".
    

To maybe collect network response body given request and response:

1.  If response’s status is a redirect status, return.
    
    NOTE: For redirects, only the final response body is stored.
    
2.  Let collected data be get collected data with request’s request id and "response".
    
3.  If collected data is null, return.
    
    NOTE: This might happen if there are no collectors setup when the response is created, and WebDriver BiDi clone network response body does not clone the corresponding body. Or if the body was null in the first place.
    
4.  Let size be response’s response body info’s encoded size.
    
    NOTE: There is a discrepancy between the fact that the bytes retrieved from the fetch stream correspond to the decoded data, but the encoded (network) size is used in order to calculate size limits. Implementations might decide to use a storage model such that it uses less size than storing the decoded data, as long as the data returned to clients in getData is identical to the decoded data. The potential tradeoff between storage and performance is up to the implementation.
    
5.  Maybe collect network data with request, collected data, size and "response".
    

To maybe collect network data given request request, network data collected data, js-uint size and network.DataType data type:

1.  Set collected data’s pending to false.
    
2.  Let navigable be get navigable for request with request.
    
3.  If navigable is null:
    
    1.  Remove collected data from collected network data.
        
    2.  Resume with "`network data collected`" and (request’s request id, data type).
        
    3.  Return.
        
    
    This prevents collecting data not related to a navigable. We still need to retrieve the navigable to check against the collector configuration but we could still accept null here.
    
4.  Let top-level navigable be navigable’s top-level traversable.
    
5.  Let collectors be an empty list.
    
6.  For each session in active BiDi sessions:
    
    1.  For each collector in session’s network collectors:

            1.  Append collector to collectors.
                
7.  If collectors is empty:
    
    1.  Remove collected data from collected network data.
        
    2.  Resume with "`network data collected`" and (request’s request id, data type).
        
    3.  Return.
        
8.  Let bytes be null.
    
9.  Let processBody given nullOrBytes be this step:
    
    1.  If nullOrBytes is not null:
        
        1.  Set bytes to serialize protocol bytes with nullOrBytes.
            
        2.  If size is null, set size to bytes’ length.
            
10.  Let processBodyError be this step: Do nothing.
     
11.  Fully read collected data’s cloned body given processBody and processBodyError.
     
12.  If bytes is not null:
     
     1.  For collector in collectors:
         
         1.  If size is less than or equal to collector’s max encoded item size, append collector’s collector to collected data’s collectors.
             
     2.  If collected data’s collectors is not empty:
         
         1.  Allocate size to record data given size.
             
         2.  Set collected data’s bytes to bytes.
             
         3.  Set collected data’s size to size.
             
     3.  Otherwise, remove collected data from collected network data.
         
13.  Resume with "`network data collected`" and (request’s request id, data type).
     

To allocate size to record data given size:

1.  Let available size be max total collected size.
    
2.  Let already collected data be an empty list.
    
3.  For each collected data in collected network data:
    
    1.  If collected data’s bytes is not null:
        
        1.  Decrease available size by collected data’s size.
            
        2.  Append collected data to already collected data
            
4.  If size is greater than available size:
    
    1.  For each collected data in already collected data:
        
        1.  Increase available size by collected data’s size.
            
        2.  Set collected data’s bytes field to null.
            
        3.  Set collected data’s size field to null.
            
        4.  If available size is greater than or equal to size, return.

        1.  Remove collected data from collected network data.
            

#### 7.5.3. Network Intercepts

A network intercept is a mechanism to allow remote ends to intercept and modify network requests and responses.

A BiDi session has an intercept map which is a map between intercept id and a struct with fields `url patterns`, `phases`, and `contexts` that define the properties of active network intercepts. It is initially empty.

A BiDi session has a blocked request map, used to track the requests which are actively being blocked. It is an map between request id and a struct with fields `request`, `phase`, and `response`. It is initially empty.

To get the network intercepts given session, event, request, and navigable id:

1.  Let session intercepts be session’s intercept map.
    
2.  Let intercepts be an empty list.
    
3.  Run the steps under the first matching condition:
    
    event is "`network.beforeRequestSent`"
    
    Set phase to "`beforeRequestSent`".
    
    event is "`network.responseStarted`"
    
    Set phase to "`responseStarted`".
    
    event is "`network.authRequired`"
    
    Set phase to "`authRequired`".

##### 7.5.4.19. The network.UrlPattern Type

`Remote end definition`

```
network.UrlPattern
```

A `network.UrlPattern` represents a pattern used for matching request URLs for network intercepts.

When URLs are matched against a `network.UrlPattern` the URL is parsed, and each component is compared for equality with the corresponding field in the pattern, if present. Missing fields from the pattern always match.

Note: This syntax is designed with future extensibility in mind. In particular the syntax forbids characters that are treated specially in the \[URLPattern\] specification. These can be escaped by prefixing them with a U+005C (\\) character.

To unescape URL pattern given pattern

1.  Let forbidden characters be the set of codepoints «U+0028 ((), U+0029 ()), U+002A (\*), U+007B ({), U+007D (})»
    
2.  Let result be the empty string.
    
3.  Let is escaped character be false.
    
4.  For each codepoint in pattern:
    
    1.  If is escaped character is false:
        
        1.  If forbidden characters contains codepoint, return error with error code invalid argument.
            
        2.  If codepoint is U+005C (\\):
            
            1.  Set is escaped character to true.
                
            2.  Continue.
                
    2.  Append codepoint to result.
        
    3.  Set is escaped character to false.
        
5.  Return success with data result.

                2.  Take implementation-defined steps to ensure that request uses the proxy settings defined by the proxy configuration.
                    
                    Note: the settings are validated when the user context is created and so are assumed to be valid at this stage; any error accessing the proxy will be reported as a network error when handling the request.
                    
2.  Maybe collect network request body with request.
    
3.  If before request sent map does not contain request, set before request sent map\[request\] to a new set.

##### 7.5.6.4. The network.responseCompleted Event

Event Type

```
network.ResponseCompleted
```

This event is emitted after the full response body is received.

The remote end event trigger is the WebDriver BiDi response completed steps given request request and response response:

1.  Let redirect count be request’s redirect count.
    
2.  Assert: before request sent map\[request\] contains redirect count.
    
    Note: This implies that every caller needs to ensure that the WebDriver BiDi before request sent steps are invoked with request before these steps.
    
3.  If request’s client is not null, let related navigables be the result of get related navigables with request’s client. Otherwise let related navigables be an empty set.

Event Type

```
network.ResponseStarted
```

This event is emitted after the response headers are received but before the body is complete.

The remote end event trigger is the WebDriver BiDi response started steps given request request and response response:

1.  Let redirect count be request’s redirect count.
    
2.  Assert: before request sent map\[request\] is equal to redirect count.
    
    Note: This implies that every caller needs to ensure that the WebDriver BiDi before request sent steps are invoked with request before these steps.
    
3.  If request’s client is not null, let related navigables be the result of get related navigables with request’s client. Otherwise let related navigables be an empty set.

        1.  Let blocked requests be session’s blocked request map.
            
        2.  Let request id be request’s request id.
            
        3.  Set blocked requests\[request id\] to (request, "`beforeRequestSent`", response).
            
        4.  Let (response, status) be await with «"`continue request`"», and request id.
            
        5.  If status is "`complete`", set response status to status.
            
        6.  Remove blocked requests\[request id\].

### 7.6. The script Module

The script module contains commands and events relating to script realms and execution.

#### 7.6.1. Definition

`Remote end definition`

```
ScriptCommand
```

`local end definition`

```
ScriptResult
```

#### 7.6.2. Preload Scripts

A Preload script is one which runs on creation of a new `Window`, before any author-defined script have run.

TODO: Extend this to scripts in other kinds of realms.

A BiDi session has a preload script map which is a map in which the keys are UUIDs, and the values are structs with an item named `function declaration`, which is a string, an item named `arguments`, which is a list, an item named `contexts`, which is a list or null, an item named `sandbox`, which is a string or null, and an item named `user contexts`, which is a set.

Note: If executing a preload script fails, either due to a syntax error, or a runtime exception, an \[ECMAScript\] exception is reported in the realm in which it was being executed, and other preload scripts run as normal.

To run WebDriver BiDi preload scripts given environment settings:

1.  Let document be environment settings’ relevant global object’s associated `Document`.
    
2.  Let navigable be document’s navigable.
    
3.  Let user context be navigable’s associated user context.
    
4.  Let user context id be user context’s user context id.
    
5.  For each session in active BiDi sessions:
    
    1.  For each preload script in session’s preload script map’s values:
        
        1.  If preload script’s `user contexts`’s size is not zero:
            
            1.  If preload script’s `user contexts` does not contain user context id, continue.
                
        2.  If preload script’s `contexts` is not null:
            
            1.  Let navigable id be navigable’s top-level traversable’s id.
                
            2.  If preload script’s `contexts` does not contain navigable id, continue.
                
        3.  If preload script’s `sandbox` is not null, let realm be get or create a sandbox realm with preload script’s `sandbox` and navigable. Otherwise let realm be environment settings’ realm execution context’s Realm component.
            
        4.  Let exception reporting global be be environment settings’ realm execution context’s Realm component’s global object.
            
        5.  Let arguments be preload script’s `arguments`.
            
        6.  Let deserialized arguments be an empty list.
            
        7.  For each argument in arguments:
            
            1.  Let channel be create a channel with session, realm and argument.
                
            2.  Append channel to deserialized arguments.
                
        8.  Let base URL be the API base URL of environment settings.
            
        9.  Let options be the default script fetch options.
            
        10.  Let function declaration be preload script’s `function declaration`.
             
        11.  Let function body evaluation status be the result of evaluate function body with function declaration, environment settings, base URL, and options.
             
        12.  If function body evaluation status is an abrupt completion, then report an exception given by function body evaluation status.\[\[Value\]\] for exception reporting global.
             
        13.  Let function object be function body evaluation status.\[\[Value\]\].
             
        14.  If IsCallable(function object) is `false`:
             
             1.  Let error be a new TypeError object in realm.
                 
             2.  Report an exception error for exception reporting global.
                 
        15.  Prepare to run script with environment settings.
             
        16.  Set evaluation status to Call(function object, null, deserialized arguments).
             
        17.  Clean up after running script with environment settings.
             
        18.  If evaluation status is an abrupt completion, then report an exception given by evaluation status.\[\[Value\]\] for exception reporting global.

##### 7.6.3.12. The script.RealmType Type

`Remote end definition` and `local end definition`

```
script.RealmType
```

The `script.RealmType` type represents the different types of Realm.

##### 7.6.3.13. The script.RemoteReference Type

`Remote end definition`

```
script.RemoteReference
```

The `script.RemoteReference` type is either a `script.RemoteObjectReference` representing a remote reference to an existing ECMAScript object in handle object map in the given Realm, or is a `script.SharedReference` representing a reference to a node.

handle "stale object reference" case.

Note: if the provided reference has both `handle` and `sharedId`, the algorithm will ignore `handle` and respect only `sharedId`.

To deserialize remote reference given remote reference, realm and session:

1.  Assert remote reference matches the `script.RemoteReference` production.
    
2.  If remote reference matches the `script.SharedReference` production, return deserialize shared reference with remote reference, realm and session.
    
3.  Return deserialize remote object reference with remote reference and realm.
    

To deserialize remote object reference given remote object reference and realm:

1.  Let handle id be the value of the `handle` field of remote object reference.
    
2.  Let handle map be realm’s handle object map
    
3.  If handle map does not contain handle id, then return error with error code no such handle.
    
4.  Return success with data handle map\[handle id\].
    

To deserialize shared reference given shared reference, realm and session:

1.  Assert shared reference matches the `script.SharedReference` production.
    
2.  Let navigable be get the navigable with realm.
    
3.  If navigable is `null`, return error with error code no such node.
    
    Note: This happens when the realm isn’t a Window global.
    
4.  Let shared id be the value of the `sharedId` field of shared reference.
    
5.  Let node be result of trying to get a node with session, navigable and shared id.
    
6.  If node is `null`, return error with error code no such node.
    
7.  Let environment settings be the environment settings object whose realm execution context’s Realm component is realm.
    
8.  If node’s node document’s origin is not same origin domain with environment settings’s origin then return error with error code no such node.
    
    Note: This ensures that WebDriver-BiDi can not be used to pass objects between realms that do not otherwise permit script access.
    
9.  Let realm global object be the global object of the realm.
    
10.  If the realm global object is `SandboxWindowProxy` object, set node to the `SandboxProxy` wrapping node in the realm.
     
11.  Return success with data node.
     

##### 7.6.3.14. The script.RemoteValue Type

`Remote end definition` and `local end definition`

```
script.RemoteValue
```

Add WASM types?

Should WindowProxy get attributes in a similar style to Node?

handle String / Number / etc. wrapper objects specially?

Values accessible from the ECMAScript runtime are represented by a mirror object, specified as `script.RemoteValue`. The value’s type is specified in the `type` property. In the case of JSON-representable primitive values, this contains the value in the `value` property; in the case of non-JSON-representable primitives, the `value` property contains a string representation of the value.

For non-primitive objects, the `handle` property, when present, contains a unique string handle to the object. The handle is unique for each serialization. The remote end will keep objects with a corresponding handle alive until such a time that `script.disown` is called with that handle, or the realm itself is to be discarded (e.g. due to navigation).

For some non-primitive types, the `value` property contains a representation of the data in the ECMAScript object; for container types this can contain further `script.RemoteValue` instances. The `value` property can be null or omitted if there is a duplicate object i.e. the object has already been serialized in the current `script.RemoteValue`, perhaps as part of a cycle, or otherwise when the maximum serialization depth is reached.

In case of duplicated objects in the same `script.RemoteValue`, the value is provided only for one of the remote values, while the unique-per-ECMAScript-object `internalId` is provided for all the duplicated objects for a given serialization.

Nodes are also represented by `script.RemoteValue` instances. These have a partial serialization of the node in the value property.

reconsider mirror objects' lifecycle.

Note: mirror objects do not keep the original object alive in the runtime. If an object is discarded in the runtime, subsequent attempts to access it via the protocol will result in an error.

To get the handle for an object given realm, ownership type and object:

1.  If ownership type is equal "`none`", return `null`.
    
2.  Let handle id be a new, unique, string handle for object.
    
3.  Let handle map be realm’s handle object map
    
4.  Set handle map\[handle id\] to object.
    
5.  Return handle id as a result.
    

To get shared id for a node given node, and session:

1.  Let node be unwrapped node.
    
2.  If node does not implement `Node`, return null.
    
3.  Let navigable be node’s node navigable.
    
4.  If navigable is null, return null.
    
5.  Return get or create a node reference with session, navigable and node.
    

To set internal ids if needed given serialization internal map, remote value and object:

1.  If the serialization internal map does not contain object, set serialization internal map\[object\] to remote value.
    
2.  Otherwise, run the following steps:
    
    1.  Let previously serialized remote value be serialization internal map\[object\].
        
    2.  If previously serialized remote value does not have a field `internalId`, run the following steps:
        
        1.  Let internal id be the string representation of a UUID based on truly random, or pseudo-random numbers.
            
        2.  Set the `internalId` field of previously serialized remote value to internal id.
            
    3.  Set the `internalId` field of remote value to a field `internalId` in previously serialized remote value.
        

To serialize as a remote value given value, serialization options, an ownership type, a serialization internal map, a realm and a session:

1.  Let remote value be a result of serialize primitive protocol value given a value.
    
2.  If remote value is not undefined, return remote value.
    
3.  Let handle id be the handle for an object with realm, ownership type and value.

The `script.SharedId` type represents a reference to a DOM `Node` that is usable in any realm (including Sandbox Realms).

##### 7.6.3.18. The script.StackFrame Type

`Remote end definition` and `local end definition`

```
script.StackFrame
```

A frame in a stack trace is represented by a `StackFrame` object. This has a `url` property, which represents the URL of the script, a `functionName` property which represents the name of the executing function, and `lineNumber` and `columnNumber` properties, which represent the line and column number of the executed code.

##### 7.6.3.19. The script.StackTrace Type

`Remote end definition` and `local end definition`

```
script.StackTrace
```

The `script.StackTrace` type represents the javascript stack at a point in script execution.

Note: The details of how to get a list of stack frames, and the properties of that list are underspecified, and therefore the details here are implementation defined.

It is assumed that an implementation is able to generate a list of stack frames, which is a list with one entry for each item in the javascript call stack, starting from the most recent. Each entry is a single stack frame corresponding to execution of a statement or expression in a script script, which contains the following fields:

script url

The url of the resource containing script

function

The name of the function being executed

line number

The zero-based line number of the executed code, relative to the top of the resource containing script.

column number

The zero-based column number of the executed code, relative to the start of the line in the resource containing script.

To construct a stack trace, with a list of stack frames stack:

1.  Let call frames be a new list.
    
2.  For each stack frame frame in stack, starting from the most recently executed frame, run the following steps:
    
    1.  Let url be the result of running the URL serializer, given the URL of frame’s script url.
        
    2.  Let frame info be a new map matching the `script.StackFrame` production, with the `url` field set to url, the `functionName` field set to frame’s function, the `lineNumber` field set to frame’s line number and the `columnNumber` field set to frame’s column number.
        
3.  Append frame info to call frames.
    
4.  Let stack trace be a new map matching the `script.StackTrace` production, with the `callFrames` property set to call frames.
    
5.  Return stack trace.
    

The current stack trace is the result of construct a stack trace given a list of stack frames representing the callstack of the running execution context.

The stack trace for an exception with an exception, or a Completion Record of type `throw`, exception, is given by:

1.  If exception is a value that has been thrown as an exception, let record be the Completion Record created to throw exception. Otherwise let record be exception.
    
2.  Let stack be the list of stack frames corresponding to execution at the point record was created.
    
3.  Return construct a stack trace given stack.
    

##### 7.6.3.20. The script.Source Type

`Local end definition`

```
script.Source
```

The `script.Source` type represents a `script.Realm` with an optional `browsingContext.BrowsingContext` and related `browser.UserContext` in which a script related event occurred.

To get the source given source realm:

1.  Let realm be the realm id for source realm.
    
2.  Let environment settings be the environment settings object whose realm execution context’s Realm component is source realm.
    
3.  If environment settings has a associated `Document`:

    2.  Let navigable be document’s node navigable.
        
    3.  Let navigable id be the navigable id for navigable if navigable is not null.
        
    4.  Let user context id be the user context id of navigable’s associated user context.
        
    
    Otherwise let navigable be null.
    
4.  Let source be a map matching the `script.Source` production with the `realm` field set to realm, the `context` field set to navigable id if navigable is not null, or unset otherwise, and the `userContext` field set to user context id if |navigable is not null, or unset otherwise.
    
5.  Return source.
    

##### 7.6.3.21. The script.Target Type

`Remote end definition`

```
script.RealmTarget
```

The `script.Target` type represents a value that is either a `script.Realm` or a `browsingContext.BrowsingContext`. This is useful in cases where a navigable identifier can stand in for the realm associated with the navigable’s active document.

To get a realm from a navigable given navigable id and sandbox:

1.  Let navigable be the result of trying to get a navigable with navigable id.
    
2.  If sandbox is null or is an empty string:
    
    1.  Let document be navigable’s active document.
        
    2.  Let environment settings be the environment settings object whose relevant global object’s associated `Document` is document.
        
    3.  Let realm be environment settings’ realm execution context’s Realm component.
        
3.  Otherwise: let realm be result of trying to get or create a sandbox realm given sandbox and navigable.
    
4.  Return success with data realm
    

This has the wrong error code

To get a realm from a target given target:

1.  If target matches the `script.ContextTarget` production:
    
    1.  Let sandbox be null.
        
    2.  If target contains "`sandbox`", set sandbox to target\["`sandbox`"\].
        
    3.  Let realm be get a realm from a navigable with target\["`context`"\] and sandbox.
        
2.  Otherwise:
    
    1.  Assert: target matches the `script.RealmTarget` production.
        
    2.  Let realm id be the value of the `realm` field of target.
        
    3.  Let realm be get a realm given realm id.
        
3.  Return success with data realm

#### 7.7.2. Types

##### 7.7.2.1. The storage.PartitionKey Type

`Local end definition`

```
storage.PartitionKey
```

The `storage.PartitionKey` type represents a storage partition key.

The following table of standard storage partition key attributes enumerates attributes with well-known meanings which a remote end may choose to support. An implementation may define additional extension storage partition key attributes.

| Attribute | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| "`userContext`" | A user context id |
| "`sourceOrigin"` | The serialization of the origin of resources that can access the storage partition |

Remote ends may support any number of extension storage partition key attributes. In order to avoid conflicts with other implementations, these attributes must begin with a unique identifier for the vendor and user-agent followed by U+003A (:).

A remote end has a map of default values for storage partition key attributes which contains zero or more entries. Each key must be a member of the table of standard storage partition key attributes where the storage partition key corresponds to a standard storage partition, or an extension storage partition key attribute where it does not, and the values represent the default value of that partition key that will be used when the user doesn’t provide an explicit value. The precise entries are implementation-defined and are determined by the storage partitioning adopted by the implementation.

A remote end has a list of required partition key attributes which contains zero or more entries. Each key must be a member of the table of standard storage partition key attributes where the storage partition key corresponds to a standard storage partition, or an extension storage partition key attribute where it does not. The precise entries are implementation-defined and are determined by the storage partitioning adopted by the implementation. This list includes only partition keys for which no default is available. As such the list must not share any entries with the keys of default values for storage partition key attributes.

6.  Return success with data partition key.
    

To get the cookie store given storage partition key:

1.  If storage partition key uniquely identifies an extant storage partition:
    
    1.  Let store be the cookie store of that storage partition.
        
    2.  Return success with data store.
        
2.  Return error with error code no such storage partition.
    

To match cookie given stored cookie and filter:

1.  For each name → value in filter:
    
    1.  If stored cookie\[name\] does not equal value:
        
        1.  Return false.
            
2.  Return true.
    

To get matching cookies given cookie store and filter:

### 7.8. The log Module

The log module contains functionality and events related to logging.

A BiDi Session has a log event buffer which is a map from navigable id to a list of log events for that context that have not been emitted. User agents may impose a maximum size on this buffer, subject to the condition that if events A and B happen in the same context with A occurring before B, and both are added to the buffer, the entry for B must not be removed before the entry for A.

To buffer a log event given session, navigables and event:

1.  Let buffer be session’s log event buffer.
    
2.  Let navigable ids be a new list.
    
3.  For each navigable of navigables:
    
    1.  Append the navigable id for navigable to navigable ids.
        
4.  For each navigable id in navigable ids:
    
    1.  Let other navigables be an empty list
        
    2.  For each other id in navigable ids:
        
    3.  If other id is not equal to navigable id, append other id to other navigables.
        
    4.  If buffer does not contain navigable id, let buffer\[navigable id\] be a new list.
        
    5.  Append (event, other navigables) to buffer\[navigable id\].
        

Note: we store the other navigables here so that each event is only emitted once. In practice this is only relevant for workers that can be associated with multiple navigables.

Do we want to key this on browsing context or top-level traversable? The difference is in what happens if an event occurs in a frame and that frame is then navigated before the local end subscribes to log events for the top level navigable.

#### 7.8.1. Definition

`Local end definition`

```
LogEvent
```

#### 7.8.2. Types

##### 7.8.2.1. log.LogEntry

`Local end definition`

```
log.Level
```

Each log event is represented by a `log.Entry` object. This has a `type` property which represents the type of log entry added, a `level` property representing severity, a `source` property representing the origin of the log entry, a `text` property with the log message string itself, and a `timestamp` property corresponding to the time the log entry was generated. Specific variants of the `log.Entry` are used to represent logs from different sources, and provide additional fields specific to the entry type.

#### 7.8.3. Events

##### 7.8.3.1. The log.entryAdded Event

Event Type

```
log.EntryAdded
```

The remote end event trigger is:

Define the following console steps with method, args, and options:

1.  For each session in active BiDi sessions:

         Otherwise, buffer a log event with session, related browsing contexts, and body.
         

Define the following error reporting steps with arguments script, line number, column number, message and handled:

1.  If handled is true return.

        Otherwise, buffer a log event with session, related browsing contexts, and body.
        

Lots more things require logging. CDP has LogEntryAdded types xml, javascript, network, storage, appcache, rendering, security, deprecation, worker, violation, intervention, recommendation, other. These are in addition to the js exception and console API types that are represented by different methods.

Allow implementation-defined log types

The remote end subscribe steps, with subscribe priority 10, given session, navigables and include global are:

1.  For each navigable id → events in session’s log event buffer:
    
    1.  Let maybe context be the result of getting a navigable given navigable id.
        
    2.  If maybe context is an error, remove navigable id from log event buffer and continue.
        
    3.  Let navigable be maybe context’s data
        
    4.  Let top level navigable be navigable’s top-level traversable.
        
    5.  If include global is true and top level navigable is not in navigables, or if include global is false and top level navigable is in navigables:
        
        1.  For each (event, other navigables) in events:

#### 7.10.2. Types

##### 7.10.2.1. The webExtension.Extension Type

```
webExtension.Extension
```

The `webExtension.Extension` type represents a web extension id within a remote end.

#### 7.10.3. Commands

##### 7.10.3.1. The webExtension.install Command

The webExtension.install command installs a web extension in the remote end.

Command Type

```
webExtension.Install
```

Return Type

```
webExtension.InstallResult
```

To given bytes:

1.  Perform implementation defined steps to decode bytes using the zip compression algorithm. TODO: Find a better reference for zip decoding.
    
2.  If the previous step failed (e.g. because bytes did not represent valid zip-compressed data) then return error with error code invalid web extension. Otherwise let entry be a directory entry containing the extracted filesystem entries.
    
3.  Return entry.
    

To expand a web extension data spec given extension data spec:

1.  Let type be extension data spec\["`type`"\].
    
2.  If installing a web extension using type isn’t supported return error with error code unsupported operation.
    
3.  In the following list of conditions and associated steps, run the first set of steps for which the associated condition is true:
    
    type is the string "`path`"
    
    1.  Let path be extension data spec\["`path`"\].
        
    2.  Let locator be a directory locator with path path and root corresponding to the root of the file system.
        
    3.  Let entry be locate an entry given locator.
        
    
    type is the string "`archivePath`"
    
    1.  Let archive path be extension data spec\["`path`"\].
        
    2.  Let locator be a file locator with path archive path and root corresponding to the root of the file system.
        
    3.  Let archive entry be locate an entry given locator.
        
    4.  If archive entry is null, return null.
        
    5.  Let bytes be archive entry’s binary data.
        
    6.  Let entry be the result of trying to extract a zip archive given bytes.
        
    
    type is the string "`base64`"
    
    1.  Let bytes be forgiving-base64 decode extension data spec\["`value`"\].
        
    2.  If bytes is failure, return null.
        
    3.  Let entry be the result of trying to extract a zip archive given bytes.
        
    
4.  Return entry.
    

The remote end steps with command parameters are:

1.  If installing web extensions isn’t supported return error with error code unsupported operation.
    
2.  Let extension data spec be command parameters\["`extensionData`"\].
    
3.  Let extension directory entry be the result of trying to expand a web extension data spec with extension data spec.
    
4.  If extension directory entry is null, return error with error code invalid web extension.
    
5.  Perform implementation defined steps to install a web extension from extension directory entry. If this fails, return error with error code invalid web extension. Otherwise let extension id be the unique identifier of the newly installed web extension.
    
6.  Let result be a map matching the `webExtension.InstallResult` production with the `extension` field set to extension id.
    
7.  Return success with data result.
    

Note: Browsers might install the web extension only temporarily by default so that they will be automatically uninstalled during the next shutdown.

##### 7.10.3.2. The webExtension.uninstall Command

The webExtension.uninstall command uninstalls a web extension for the remote end.

Command Type

```
webExtension.Uninstall
```

Return Type

```
webExtension.UninstallResult
```

## 8\. Patches to Other Specifications

This specification requires some changes to external specifications to provide the necessary integration points. It is assumed that these patches will be committed to the other specifications as part of the standards process.

### 8.1. HTML

The report an error algorithm is modified with an additional step at the end:

1.  Call any error reporting steps defined in external specifications with script, line, col, message, and true if the error is handled, or false otherwise.
    

### 8.2. Console

Other specifications can define console steps.

1.  At the point when the Printer operation is called with arguments name, printerArgs and options (which is undefined if the argument is not provided), call any console steps defined in external specification with arguments name, printerArgs, and options.
    

### 8.3. CSS

#### 8.3.1. Determine the device pixel ratio

Insert the following steps at the start of the determine the device pixel ratio algorithm:

1.  If device pixel ratio overrides contains window’s navigable, return device pixel ratio overrides\[window’s navigable\].
